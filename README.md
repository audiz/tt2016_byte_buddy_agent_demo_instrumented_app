## Byte Buddy demo: application changed by Java Agent

A simple SpringBoot application prepared as part of the [Byte Buddy demo](https://github.com/jakubhalun/tt2016_byte_buddy_agent_demo) for Motorola Tech Talks 2016 in Krak√≥w.
During the demo it is instrumented by the agent which adds more logs to it.

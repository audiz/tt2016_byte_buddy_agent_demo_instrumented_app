## Application for instrumentation for Byte Buddy Java agent

This is simple SpringBoot REST application prepared as part of the [Byte Buddy Java agent demo](https://github.com/jakubhalun/tt2016_byte_buddy_agent_demo) for Motorola Tech Talks 2016 in Krak√≥w.
It is going to be instrumented by the agent to add more logs.
